//Assignment2
//Question: Choose any experiment (with finite sample space) and write a program that will
//a) print its sample space;
//b) assuming that all outcomes are equally likely, make a choice of outcome.

//Experiment is Tossing of two Coins.
//Sample Space is a set of all possible outcomes of any random experiment.
//Outcomes in a sample space 'S' are equally-likely if each has the same chance/probability of occurrence.
//If a sample space contains a finite number of elements, then the sample space is said to be a finite sample space. The sample space for the experiment of a toss of a coin contains only two possible outcomes, so it is an example of finite sample space.
